<h2>NOTES</h2>
<h3>ETYMOLOGY OF PENNIEL.</h3>
<p>Some eighteen years ago, the writer of the following sonnets, by
the kindness of the proprietors of a pleasant house upon the banks
of the Teviot, enjoyed two happy autumns there. The Roman road
which runs between the remains of the camp at Chew Green, in
Northumberland, and the Eildon Hills (the Trimontium of General
Roy), passed hard by. The road is yet distinctly visible in all its
course among the Cheviots, and in the uncultivated tracts; and
occasionally also, where the plough has spared it, among the
agricultural inclosures.</p>
<p>The house stands near the base of the hill called Penniel or
Penniel-heugh: and it is hoped that the etymological derivation of
that word now to be hazarded will not imply in the etymologist the
credulity of a Monkbarns. <i>Pen</i>, it is known, signifies in the
Celtic language "a hill". And the word <i>heil</i>, in the
Celto-Scythian, is, in the Latin, rendered <i>Sol</i>. In the
Armoric dialect of the Celtic also, <i>heol</i> means "the sun:"
hence, <i>Penheil</i>, <i>Penheol</i>, or <i>Penniel</i>, "the hill
of the sun." Beyond the garden of the abode there stood, and, it is
believed, yet stands, a single stone of a once extensive Druid
circle, not many years ago destroyed by the then proprietor, who
used the sacred remains in building his garden wall. A little
farther antiquarian conjecture is necessary to clothe the country
with oak woods. Jedwood or Jedworth Forest was part of "the forest"
which covered Selkirkshire and parts of the counties around. The
Capon Tree, and the King of the Wood, two venerable oaks yet
flourishing on the water of Jed, attest the once wooded condition
of the land; which is farther irresistibly corroborated by evidence
drawn from the interesting volumes of the <i>Rotuli
Parliamentorum</i>. The Bishops of Glasgow had a religious
establishment in the neighbouring sunward village of Nether Ancrum.
Of their buildings, of the vicar's house, or of the ancient gardens
existing in the memory of persons living, not a vestige now
remains. In the first volume of the <i>Rotuli</i>, p. 472., there
is a Petition, of uncertain date, by the Bishop of Glasgow to
Edward I., then in possession of Scotland, in these
terms:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Derechief pry ly dit Evesqe a soen Segur le Roy qe ly plese
aider &amp;c.... e sur ceo transmettr', sa lettre al vesconte de
Lanark. E une autre, si ly plest, a ses Forresters de Geddeworth de
autant de Merin [meremium, meheremium, wood for building] pour fere
une receite a Allyncrom (Ancrum) desur la marche, ou il poet aver
recett e entendre a ses ministres qut il le voudrent aver."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To which the King's answer is,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"H&eacute;at Bre Ten' locu R. in Scoc. qd fae'. ei hre meheremiu
in Foresta de Selkirk et de Maddesleye usq ad numum quinquaginta
quercu."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, no doubt is left that oak woods abounded in the district;
and it was under the influence of these beliefs that the sonnets
were composed:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>I.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"'Twas on this spot some thousand years ago,</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page450" id=

<p>The conquering Roman when he urged his way,</p>
<p>That led to triumph, through the neighbouring plain,</p>
<p>And oped the gloomy grove to glare of day,</p>
<p>Awe-stricken gazed, and spared the sacred fane!</p>
<p>One stone of all its circle now remains,</p>
<p>Saved from the modern Goth's destructive hand;</p>
<p>And by its side I muse: and Fancy reigns;</p>
<p>And giant oaks on Pennial waving stand;</p>

<p>And record none remains save this gray stone!</p>
<p>Then come the warlike Saxons; and the years</p>

<p>Uprears his Bloody raven; and his spears</p>
<p>Bristling upon the Broadlaw summit's plain</p>
<p>Spread terror o'er the vale: and still rude times</p>
<p>Succeed; and Border feuds with conflagration light</p>
<p>Nightly, the Teviot's wave, and ceaseless crimes</p>
<p>Chase from the holy towers their inmates in affright.</p>

<h3>NOTES ON CUNNINGHAM'S HANDBOOK FOR LONDON.</h3>
<p><i>Soho Square.</i>&mdash;Your correspondent "NASO" (p. 244.)
has anticipated me in noticing Mr. Cunningham's mistake about Mrs.
Cornellys' house in this square; but he has left unnoticed some
particulars which deserve to be recorded. Mrs. Cornellys', or
<i>Carlisle House</i> as it was called, was pulled down at the
beginning of the present century (1803 or 1804), and <i>two</i>
houses built upon its site, now <i>Jeffery's Music Warehouse</i>
and <i>Weston's Printing Office</i>. Some curious old paintings
representing banqueting scenes, formerly in <i>Carlisle House</i>
were carefully preserved until the last few years, in the
drawing-room of the corner house, when they were removed to make
room for some needed "elegancies" of the modern print shops. The
Catholic Chapel in Sutton Street was the banquetting-room of
Carlisle House; and the connecting passage between it and the house
in Soho Square was originally the "Chinese bridge."</p>
<p>"Teresa Cornelys, Carlisle House, St. Ann, Soho, dealer" appears
in the bankrupt list of <i>The London Gazette</i> of November,
1772; and in December of the same year, this temple of festivity,
and all its gorgeous contents, were thus advertised to be sold by
public auction:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<i>Carlisle House, Soho.</i>&mdash;At twelve o'clock on Monday
the 14th instant, by Order of the Assignees, Mr. Marshall will sell
by Auction on the Premises, in one Lot, All that extensive,
commodious, and magnificent House in Soho Square, lately occupied
by Mrs. Cornelys, and used for the Public Assemblies of the
Nobility and Gentry. Together with all the rich and elegant
Furniture, Decorations, China, &amp;c., thereunto belonging, too
well-known and universally admired for their aptness and taste to
require here any public and extraordinary description thereof.
Catalogues to be had at the House, and at Mr. Marshall's, in St.
Martin's Lane. The curiosity of many to see the house, to prevent
improper crowds, and the great damage that might happen therefrom
(and the badness of this season) by admitting indifferent and
disinterested people, must be an excuse to the public for the
Assignees ordering the Catalogues to be sold at 5<i>s.</i> each,
which will admit two to see the house, &amp;c., from Monday the 7th
instant to the time of sale, Sundays excepted, from ten in the
morning to three in the afternoon, and they hope no person or
persons will take amiss being refused admittance without
Catalogues."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In December 1774, the nobility and gentry were informed (by
advertisement), "That the Assemblies at Carlisle House will
commence soon, under the conduct and direction of a <i>New</i>
Manager;" but notwithstanding the efforts of this person, we find
that Mrs. Cornellys resumed her revels here with great spirit in
1776. In 1778, Carlisle House was again publicly advertised to be
sold by private contract, or "to be hired as usual;" and
subsequently, after having been used as a common exhibition room of
"Monstrosities," a "School of Eloquence," and "An Infant School of
Genius," it closed its public career through the interference of
the magistracy in 1797.</p>
<p>A full and particular account of the rise and fall of "Mrs.
Cornelys' Entertainments at Carlisle House, Soho," was privately
printed two or three years ago, by Thomas Mackinlay, Esq., of the
firm of Dalmaine and Co., Soho Square.</p>
<p><i>Carlisle Street, Soho Square.</i>&mdash;The large house at
the end of this street, looking into the square, was formerly
called <i>Carlisle House</i>. In 1770 it was purchased of Lord
Delaval by the elder Angelo; who resided in it many years, and
built a large riding-school at the back. Bach and Abel, of
"Concert" notoriety, resided in the adjoining house. Carlisle
Street was then called <i>King's Square Court</i>.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page451" id=
"page451"></a>{451}</span>
<p><i>Catherine Street, Strand.</i>&mdash;In 1714, a tract was
published with the following title:&mdash;<i>The Maypole's New
Year's Gift or Thanks returned to his Benefactors, humbly inscribed
to the Two Corners of</i> Catherine Street, Strand; <i>written by a
Parishioner of St. Mary, Savoy</i>.</p>
<p><i>Maiden Lane, Covent Garden.</i>&mdash;The well known "Cider
Cellar" in this lane was opened about 1730. There is a curious
tract, entitled <i>Adventures under Ground</i>, 1750, which
contains some strange notices of this "Midnight Concert Room."</p>
<p><i>Salisbury Change.</i>&mdash;Cibber, in the amusing <i>Apology
for his Life</i>, has the following:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Taste and fashion, with us, have always had wings, and fly from
one public spectacle to another so wantonly, that I have been
informed by those who remember it, that a famous puppet-show in
<i>Salisbury Change</i> (then standing where <i>Cecil Street</i>
now is), so far distressed these two celebrated companies, that
they were reduced to petition the king for relief against it."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>The New Exchange.</i>&mdash;A good description of this once
popular mart may be found in Lodwick Rowzee's <i>Treatise on the
Queene's Welles</i>, Lond. 1632. It is as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We went to see the <i>New Exchange</i>, which is not far from
the place of the Common Garden, in the great street called the
Strand. The building has a facade of stone, built after the Gothic
style, which has lost its colour from age, and is becoming
blackish. It contains two long and double galleries, one above the
other, in which are distributed several rows great numbers of very
rich shops, of drapers and mercers, filled with goods of every
kind, and with manufactures of the most beautiful description.
There are, for the most part, under the care of well-dressed women,
who are busily employed in work, although many are served by young
men, called apprentices."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>The Bedford Coffee House, Covent Garden.</i>&mdash;In 1763
appeared a small volume under the title of <i>Memoirs of the
Bedford Coffee House, by Genius, dedicated to the most Impudent Man
alive</i>.</p>
<p class="author">EDWARD F. RIMBAULT.</p>
<hr />
<h3>ORIGINAL LETTER OF PETER LE NEVE.</h3>
<p>The following was a letter from Le Neve to a Mr. Admall, a
herald painter at Wakefield, found in a book of arms belonging to
the latter, which came into my possession a few months ago.</p>
<p class="author">E. HAILSTONE.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Mr. Admall,</p>
<p>"I understand by Mr. Mangay, my deputy at Leeds for the West
Riding, that you contemn my lawfull autority of Norroy King of
Arms, and have done and will doe as you say, things relating to
heraldry, contrary to my prohibition, &amp;c.; these are therefore
to acquaint you, that if you continue in the same mind and will
usurp on my office, I intend to make you sensible of the wrong you
doe me in my office, by taking out process against you, and making
you pay for your transgression. I shall give you no hard words, but
shal be as good as my word if there is law in England to restrain
you; so chose whether you will due to me good or evill; you shall
find me according your friend or open enemy.</p>
<p>"PETER LA NEVE, Norroy.</p>
<p>"College of Arms, in London,</p>
<p>"28th May, 1719."</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h3>FOLK LORE.</h3>
<p><i>Superstitions of the Midland Counties.</i>&mdash;It is
believed a sign of "bad luck" to meet a white horse, unless the
person <i>spits</i> at it, which action is said to avert the ill
consequences of the recontre.</p>
<p>A rainy Friday is believed to be followed as a natural and
invariable consequence, by a wet Sunday; but I am not aware that
the contrary is believed, viz., that fine Friday produces a fine
Sunday.</p>
<p>If the fire burns brightly when a person has poked or stirred it
up, it is a sign that the <i>absent</i> lover, wife, or husband (as
the case may be) is in good spirits, and in good humour.</p>
<p>The itching of the right hand palm is said to portend the
reception of a gift; which is rendered more certain if the advice
in this distich be followed:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Rub it 'gainst wood,</p>
<p>'Tis sure to come good."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Persons with much hair or down upon their arms and hands, will
at some future period enjoy great wealth; or as the common
expression has it, "are born to be rich."</p>
<p class="author">HENRY KERSLEY.</p>
<p>Corp. Chris. Hall, Maidstone.</p>
<p><i>A Rainbow in the Morning, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;"Mr. THOMS" (No.
26, p. 413.) says that he believes no one has remarked the
philosophy of this proverbial rhyme. Sir Humphry Davy, however,
points it out in his <i>Salmonia</i>.</p>
<hr />
<h3>ERROR IN JOHNSON'S LIFE OF SELDEN.</h3>
<p>In Johnson's (Geo. W.) <i>Memoirs of John Selden</i>, London,
1635, 8vo. pp. 128, 129, is a notice of Dr. Sibthorpe's celebrated
Sermon preached at Northampton, and printed in 1627 with the title
of <i>Apostolike Obedience</i>. After stating the difficult
experienced in obtaining the necessary sanction for its
publication, owing to Abp. Abbot refusing the requisite
<i>imprimatur</i>, the author says that ultimately the licence was
"<i>signed by Land himself</i>, and published under the title of
<i>Apostolical Obedience</i>." A reference at the foot of the page
to "Rushworth, p. 444," leads me to conclude that it is on his
authority Mr. Johnson has made this statement; but not having
access to the "Historical Collections," I am unable to examine. At
any rate, Heylin, in his <i>Cyprianus Anglicus</i>, Lond., 1671
fol. p. 159., may be understood to imply the correctness of the
assertion.</p>
<p>A copy of this now rare sermon before me <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page452" id="page452"></a>{452}</span> proves,
however, that the statement is incorrect. At the back of the title
is as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I have read over this sermon upon <i>Rom.</i> xiii. 7.,
preached at <i>Northampton</i>, at the assises for the county,
<i>Feb.</i> 22, 1626, by <i>Robert Synthorpe</i>, Doctor of
Divinity, Vicar of Brackley, and I doe approve it as a sermon
learnedly and discreetly preached, and agreeable to the <i>ancient
Doctrine</i> of the <i>Primitive Church</i>, both for <i>Faith</i>
and <i>good manners</i>, and to the <i>Doctrine established</i> in
the <i>Church of England</i>, and, therefore, under my hand I give
authority for the printing of it, May 8. 1627."</p>
<p>GEO. LONDON.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was therefore Bishop <i>Mountague</i>, and not <i>Laud</i>,
who licensed the sermon.</p>
<p class="author">JOHN. J. DREDGE.</p>
<hr />
<h3>POPE AND PETRONIUS.</h3>
<p>I have read "Mr. RICH'S" letter with great interest, and I
willingly allow that he has combated my charge of plagiarism
against Pope, and discussed the subject generally with equal
fairness and ability. "But yet," I think that he wanders a little
from the point when he says, "the surmise of the plagiarism
originates in a misconception of the terms employed by the Latin
author, especially <i>corcillum</i>." Now the question, in my
opinion, turns not so much on what <i>Petronius said</i>, as on
what <i>Pope read</i>; i.e. not on the meaning that <i>Petronius
gave</i> to the word (<i>corcillum</i>), but on that which <i>Pope
attributed</i> to it. I cannot, without further proof, give him
credit for having read the words as critically and correctly as
"Mr. R." has done. I believe that he looked on it merely as a
simple derivative of <i>cor</i>, and therefore rendered it "worth,"
i.e. a <i>moral</i>, not a <i>mental</i> quality.</p>

<h2>QUERIES.</h2>
<h3>QUERIES RESPECTING PURVEY ON THE APOCALYPSE, AND BONNER ON THE
SEVEN SACRAMENTS.</h3>
<p>I beg leave to make the two following Queries:&mdash;</p>
<p>1. In Bayle's very useful work, <i>Scriptorum Illustrium Majoris
Brytanni&aelig; Catalogus</i>, fol. Bas. 1559, among the writings
ascribed to John Purvey, one of Wycliffe's followers, and (as
Walden styles him) <i>Glossator</i>, is mentioned <i>Commentarius
in Apocalypsin</i>, beginning "Apocalypsis, quasi diceret;" and
Bayle adds:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Pr&aelig;dictus in Apocalypsin Commentarius ex magistri Wielevi
lectionibus publicis per Joannem Purv&aelig;um collectus, et nunc
per Martinum Lutherum, <i>Ante centum annos</i> intitularus, anno
Domini 1528, sine authoris nomine, Witemberg&aelig; fuit excusus.
Fuit et ipse Author in carcere, ac cathenis insuper chalybeis, cum
ea Commentaria scripsit, ut ex decimo et undecimo ejus scripti
capite apparet. Scripsit autem Purv&aelig;us hunc librum anno
Domini 1390, ut ex decimo tertio capite et principio vigesimi
apparet."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This account of Bayle (who is mistaken, however, about the
<i>title</i> of the work) is confirmed by Panzer; who, in his
<i>Annales</i>, vol. ix. p. 87. enters the volume thus,
"<i>Commentarius in Apolcalypsin ante Centum Annos &aelig;ditus,
cum Pr&aelig;fatione Maritini Lutheri</i>. Wittemberg&aelig;, 1528.
8vo." Can any of your readers refer me to a copy of this book in a
public library, or in private hands?</p>
<p>2. In Lewis's <i>History of the Translations of the Bible</i>,
edit. 1818. p. 25., he quotes a work of Bishop Bonner, "<i>Of the
Seven Sacraments</i>, 1555," in which a manuscript English Bible is
cited by the Bishop, as then in his possession, "translated out of
Latyne in tyme of heresye almost eight-score years before that
tyme, i.e. about 1395, fayre and truly written in parchment." Lewis
proceeds to conjecture, that this MS. was the same which is
preserved in the Bodleian Library under the mark Fairfax, 2. And in
this erroneous supposition he has been followed by later writers.
The copy in question, which belonged to Bonner, is actually in the
Archiepiscopal Library at Lambeth, No. 25., and contains the
Pentateuch in the <i>earlier</i> Wycliffite version (made, no
doubt, by Nicholas Hereford), whilst the rest of the Old and New
Testament is in the <i>later</i> or revised translation by Purvey
and his coadjutors. What I now wish to inquire about, is, where can
I meet with a copy of Bonner's work, <i>De Septem Sacramentis</i>,
in which the passages occur referred to by Lewis? They are not in
<i>A Profitable and Necessarye Doctryne, with certayne Homelies
adjoyned</i>, printed in 1555 by John Carood, although one of these
homilies is on the subject of the seven sacraments.</p>

<h2>REPLIES.</h2>
<h3>LUTHER'S TRANSLATION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT.</h3>
<p>Luther's solemn request that his translation should on no
account be altered, accompanies most of the earlier editions of the
N.T. I find it on the reverse of the title-page of the edition in
8vo. printed at Wittemberg by Hans Lufft in 1537, thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I request all my friends and enemies, my master printer, and
reader, will let this New Testament be mine; and, if they have
fault to find with it, that they make one of their own. I know well
what I do, and see well what others do; but this Testament shall be
Luther's German Testament; for carping and cavilling is now without
measure or end. And be every one cautioned against other copies,
for I have already experienced how negligently and falsely others
reprint us."<a id="footnotetag1" name="footnotetag1"></a><a href=
"#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The disputed verse (1 John, v. 7.) is omitted in all the
editions printed under Luther's eye or sanction in his lifetime;
but it has not, I think, been remarked that in verse 8. the words
<i>auf erde</i>, found in later editions, are wanting. The passage
stands:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Denn drey sind die da zeugen, der Geist, und das Wasser, und
das Blut, und die drey sind beysamen."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the first edition of the Saxon (D&uuml;desche version of
Luther's Bible, by Jo. Heddersen, printed in a magnificent volume
at Lubeck, by Lo. Dietz, in 1533-4), the verse stands
thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Wente dre synt dede t&uuml;chinisse geven, de Geist unde dat
Water, unde dat Bloth, unde de dre synt by emander."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A MS. note of a former possessor remarks:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The 7th verse is not found here, nor is it in the Bibles of
Magdeburg, 1544, of Wittemberg, 1541, ditto 1584, Frankfort, 1560
and 1580."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the edition of this same version, printed by Hans Lufft,
Wittemberg, 1541, the passage is exactly similar; but in one
printed by Hans Walther, Magdeburg, 1545, the words <i>up erdeu</i>
are inserted.</p>
<p>These Saxon versions are interesting from the very great
similarity that idiom has to our early language; and they,
doubtless, influenced much our own early versions.</p>
<p>In a translation of the N.T. from the Latin of Erasmus (the
first printed in Latin with a translation on the same page, and
which is very similar in appearance to Udal's), printed at Zurich
in 1535, 4to., with a Preface by Johansen Zwikk of Constance, the
7th verse is given (as it was in the Latin); but is distinguished
by being printed in brackets, and in both verses we have&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Unnd die drey dienend in eins."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Erasmus having admitted the verse into his third edition, gave
occasion perhaps to the liberty which has been taken in later times
to print both verses, with this distinction, in editions of the
Lutheran version. The earliest edition, I believe, in which it thus
appears, is one at Wittemberg in 1596, which was repeated in 1597,
1604, 1605<a id="footnotetag2" name="footnotetag2"></a><a href=
"#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a>, and 1625. It also appears, but
printed in smaller type, in the Hamburgh Bible by Wolder in 1597,
in that of Jena 1598, and in Hutter's Nuremburg, 1599.</p>
<p>In a curious edition of the N.T. printed at Wandesbeck in 1710,
in 4to., in which four German versions, the Catholic, the Lutheran,
the Reformed, a new version by Reitz, and the received Dutch
version, are printed in parallel columns, both verses are given in
every instance; but a note points out that Luther uniformly omitted
the 7th verse, and the words <i>auf erde</i>.</p>
<p>There cannot be a doubt, therefore, that the insertion is
entirely unwarranted in any edition of the New Testament professing
to be <i>Luther's</i> translation.</p>

<p>Fr. Er. Kettner, who printed at Leipsic, in 1696, a long and

<p><i>Luther's Translation of the Bible</i> (No. 25, p.

John, after stating his opinion that the controverted passage is a
spurious interpolation, gives a list of the codices and editions in
which the passage is not found, and of those in which it is
found.</p>
<p>The passage is <i>wanting</i> in all Greek Codd. except Codd.
34. 162. 172. (of his introduction, where it is introduced from the
Vulgate), and in all MS. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page454"

during his life-time, and up to 1581; in the edit. Withenb., 1607;
Hamb. 1596. 1619. 1620.</p>
<p>The passage is <i>found</i> in all the editions printed of the
Vulgate, and in all translations from it before Luther; and the
edit. complut.; in Erasmus' of 1522, and in his paraphrase; in the
edit. of Rob. Stephens, 1546-69; and Beza, 1565-76. 1582; in the
Lutheran translations reprinted by Froschauer, Zurich, 1529-31.
(but in small type); edit. 1536-89. in brackets; edit. 1597,
without the brackets; in the edit. Frankf. 1593; Wittenb. 1596-97,
and many later ones. I may add, that the passage is in every
edition of recent date that I have seen of the Lutheran Bible, but
not, of course, in De Wette's translation.</p>

<h3>LINES ON LONDON DISSENTING MINISTERS.</h3>
<p>In reply to one of the Queries of "W." (No. 24. p. 383.), I
transcribe from the MSS. of Mr. Chewning Blackmore, a Presbyterian
minister of Worcester, the "Lines on London Dissenting Ministers of
a former Day," which I have never seen entire in print:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Behold how Papal Wright with lordly pride</p>
<p>Directs his haughty eye to either side,</p>
<p>Gives forth his doctrine with imperious nod,</p>
<p>And fraught with pride addresses e'en his God.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Not so the gentle Watts, in him we find</p>
<p>The fairest pattern of a humble mind;</p>
<p>In him the meekest, lowliest virtue dwells,</p>
<p>As mild as light, as soft as ev'ning gales.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Tuning melodious nonsense, Bradbury stands,</p>
<p>With head uplifted and with dancing hands,</p>
<p>Prone to sedition, and to slander free,</p>
<p>Sacheverell sure was but a type of thee.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Mark how the pious matrons flock around,</p>
<p>Pleased with the noise of Guyse's empty sound;</p>
<p>How sweetly each unmeaning period flows</p>
<p>To lull the audience to a gentle doze!</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Eternal Bragge in never-ending strains</p>
<p>Unfolds the mysteries Joseph's coat contains,</p>
<p>Of every hue describes a different cause,</p>
<p>And from each patch a solemn mystery draws.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"With soundest judgment and with nicest skill,</p>
<p>The learned Hunt explains his Master's will,</p>
<p>So just his meaning, and his sense to true,</p>
<p>He only pleases the discerning few.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"In Chandler's solid, well-composed discourse,</p>
<p>What wond'rous energy! what mighty force!</p>
<p>Still, friend to Truth, and strict to Reason's rules,</p>
<p>He scorns the censure of unthinking fools.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"But see the accomplish'd orator appear,</p>
<p>Refined his language, and his reasoning dear,</p>
<p>Thou only, Foster, has the pleasing art,</p>
<p>At once to please the ear and mend the heart!</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Lawrence, with clear and solid judgment speaks,</p>
<p>And on the sober mind impression makes,</p>
<p>The sacred truths with justness he explains,</p>
<p>And he from ev'ry hearer praise obtains."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Of the author of these lines I can give no information. He
evidently belonged to the Anti-Calvinistic party. His name does not
appear to have been known to Mr. Walter Wilson, the historian of
the "Dissenting Churches" of London, although he quotes a portion
of them. But they were probably composed between 1728 and 1738. In
the former year, Dr. James Foster's London popularity arose, on the
occasion of his undertaking the evening lecture at the Old Jewry.
In the year 1738, Mr. Robert Bragge, one of the subjects of the
poem, died. Of this gentleman the story is told (and to it the poem
evidently alludes), that he was employed no less than four months
in developing the mysteries of Joseph's coat, from Genesis, xxxvii.
3.: "And he made him a coat of many colours." In reply to the
sarcasm on Mr. Bragge, Mr. Walter Wilson states (<i>Hist. and Ant.
of Diss.</i> ch. i. p. 247.) that the following stanza was
composed:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"The unwearied Bragge, with zeal, in moving strains,</p>
<p>Unfolds the mysteries Scripture-Book contains;</p>
<p>Marks every truth, of error shows the cause,</p>
<p>And from each mystery useful doctrine draws."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The unfavourable notice of Dr. Sam. Wright in the opening
stanza, is at variance with the general report of biographers. In
the copy of the verses in the Blackmore MSS. is this note:&mdash;"I
think this is too severe on the Dr." Dr. Wright was admired for his
pulpit elocution; and it is said that Archbishop Herring was, in
his younger years, a frequent hearer of his, with a view to improve
in elocution. The notice of the celebrated Tom Bradbury is grossly
unjust. He was a man of wit and courage, though sometimes
boisterous and personal. His unsparing opponent, Dr. Caleb Fleming,
wrote admiringly of "his musical voice, and the flow of his
periods, adapting scripture language to every
purpose."&mdash;<i>The Character of the Rev. Mr. Thos. Bradbury,

<hr />
<h3>REPLIES TO MINOR QUERIES.</h3>
<p><i>Tracts by Dekker and Nash.</i>&mdash;<i>The Raven's
Almanacke</i>, 1609, is the production of Thomas Dekker, the
dramatist, and one of the rarest of his numerous works. A copy sold
in the <i>Gordonstown</i> sale for seven guineas; and another
occurred in Mr. J.H. Bright's collection (No. 1691.); but I have
not the sale catalogue at hand to quote the price. Dekker was also
the author of a similar work, entitled <i>The Owle's Almanacke</i>,
1618; but it is not mentioned in the lists furnished by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page455" id=
"page455"></a>{455}</span> Lowndes and Dr. Nott. The latter is
indeed very inaccurate, omitting many well-known productions of the
author, and assigning others to him for which he is not answerable.
Whilst upon the subject of Dekker, I cannot resist mentioning a
fraud upon his memory which has, I believe, escaped the notice of
bibliographers. In 1697 was published a small volume, entitled,
<i>The Young Gallant's Academy, or Directions how he should behave
himself in an Ordinary, in a Playhouse, in a Tavern, &amp;c., with
the Character of a Town-Huff, by Samuel Vincent</i>. This is
nothing more than a reprint of Dekker's <i>Gull's Horn-book</i>,
with some slight alterations to adapt it to the times.</p>
<p>Nash's <i>Terrors of the Night, or a Discourse of
Apparitions</i>, was printed by John Danter for William Jones,
1594. It is a very interesting tract, and contains many personal
allusions to its unfortunate author. A copy was sold in Heber's
sale (Part IV. No. 1592.) for 5<i>l.</i> 18<i>s.</i> A note in the
handwriting of that distinguished collector gives us the following
information:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Only two other copies are known to exist, one in the Ashbridge
Library at Cleveland House, the other, not so fine as the present,
bought by Malone at Brand's, since James Boswell's, and now (1825)
<i>penes</i> me, R.H."</p>

<p>All things considered, I think your correspondent "J.E." (p.
400.) <i>may</i> congratulate himself on having "met with a
prize."</p>
<p class="author">EDWARD F. RIMBAULT.</p>
<p><i>Nash's Terrors of the Night.</i>&mdash;Excessively rare.
Boswell had a copy, and another is in the library of the Earl of
Ellesmere, described in Mr. Collier's <i>Bridgewater Catalogue</i>
as one of the worst of Nash's tracts.</p>
<p class="author">L.</p>
<p><i>Tureen</i> (No. 25. p. 407.).&mdash;The valuable reference to
Knox proves the etymology from the Latin. <i>Terrene</i>, as an

<p class="author">L.</p>
<p><i>English Translations of Erasmus' Encomium Mori&aelig;</i>
(No. 24. p. 385.).&mdash;Sir Thomas Challoner's translation of
Erasmus' <i>Praise of Folly</i> was first printed, I believe, in
1540. Subsequent impressions are dated 1549, 1569, 1577. In 1566,
William Pickering had a license "for pryntinge of a mery and
pleasaunt history, donne in tymes paste by Erasmus Roterdamus,"
which possibly might be an impression of the <i>Praise of
Folly</i>. (See Collier's <i>Extracts from the Registers of the
Stationers' Company</i>, vol. i. p. 125.). This popular work was
again translated in the latter part of the following century, by
White Kennet. It was printed at Oxford in 1683, under the title of
<i>Wit against Wisdom, or a Panegyric upon Folly</i>. This is in
all probability the intermediate translation inquired after by your
correspondent.</p>
<p class="author">EDWARD F. RIMBAULT.</p>
<p>In answer to "JARLZBERG," I beg to inform him of the following
translation of Erasmus' <i>Praise of Folly</i>:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Mori&aelig; Encomium, or the Praise of Folly, made English from
the Latin of Erasmus by W. Kennet, of S. Edm. Hall, Oxon, now Lord
Bishop of Peterborough. Adorn'd with 46 copper plates, and the
effigies of Erasmus and Sir Thos. More, all neatly engraved from
the designs of the celebrated Hans Holbeine. 4th edition.
1724."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Kennett, however, in his preface, dated 1683, alludes to two
other translations, and to Sir Thomas Challoner's as the
<i>first</i>. He does not mention the name of the second
translator, but alludes to him as "<i>the modern translator</i>,"
and as having lost a good deal of the wit of the book by having
"tied himself so strictly to a literal observance of the Latin."
This is his excuse for offering to the public a third translation,
in which he professes to have allowed himself such "elbow-room of
expression as the humoursomeness of the subject and the idiom of
the language did invite."</p>
<p class="author">HERMES.</p>
<p>The intermediate translation of the <i>Mori&aelig; Encomium</i>
of Erasmus, to which your correspondent refers, is that by John
Wilson, 8vo. London 1661, of which there is a copy in the

<p><i>Court of Wards.</i>&mdash;I cannot tell "J.B." (No. 11. p.

<p><i>Scala Coeli</i> (No. 23. p. 366.).&mdash;In Foxe's <i>Acts
and Mon.</i>, vol. v. p. 364., Lond. 1838, your Querist may see a
copy of a grant from Pope Clement VII. in 1526, to the brethren of
a Boston guild, assuring them that any member thereof who should
enter the Lady Chapel in St. Botolph's Church, Boston, once a
quarter, and say there "a Paternoster, Ave Maria, and Creed, shall
have the full remission due to them that visit the Chapel of Scala
Scoeli."</p>
<p class="author">H.W.</p>
<p><i>Twm Shawn Cattie</i> (No. 24, p. 383.).&mdash;The following
extract from Cliffe's <i>Book of South Wales</i>, furnishes a reply
to this Query.</p>
<p>In describing the beautiful mountain scenery between Llandovery
and Tregaron, he says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"High in the rock above the fall yawns a hole, hardly a cavern,
where once lurked a famous freebooter of Wales, Twm Sion Catti: the
entrance to this cave is through a narrow aperture, formed of two
immense slate rocks, which face each other, and the space between
them is narrower at the bottom than the top, so <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page456" id="page456"></a>{456}</span> that the
passage can only be entered sideways, with the figure inclined
according to the slanting of the rock.</p>
<p>"The history of Twm Sion Catti (pronounced Toom Shone Catti),
alias Thomas Jones, Esq., is very romantic. He was a natural son of
John ap David Moethe, by Catharine, natural daughter of Meredydd ap
Ivan ap Robert, grandfather of Sir John Wynne, of Gwydir (see
<i>The Heraldic Visitations of Wales</i>, published by the Welsh
MSS. Society), and is said to have died in 1630, at the age of 61.
In early life, 'he was a notorious freebooter and highwayman,' and
levied black mail on the country within reach of his mountain
abode, with the aid of a small band of followers. He soon reformed,
married a rich heiress, was then created a justice of peace for
Brecon, and ultimately became sheriff of that county and
Carmarthenshire. He was, observes Sir S.R. Meyrick, esteemed as an
antiquarian and poet, but is more known for the tricks attributed
to him as a robber."</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="author">A.B.</p>
<p><i>Twm Sion Catti.</i>&mdash;The noted robber, Twm Sion or
Sh&ocirc;n Catti, referred to at No. 24. p. 383., was a Welshman
who flourished between the years 1590 and 1630. He was the natural
son of Sir John Wynne, and obtained his surname of Catti from the
appellation of his mother Catherine. In early life he was a brigand
of the most audacious character, who plundered and terrified the
rich in such a manner that his name was a sufficient warrant for
the raising of any sum which he might desire; while his unbounded
generosity to the poor or unprotected, joined to an innate love of
fun and frolic&mdash;for he was a very Eulenspiegel&mdash;made him
the darling of the people. His chosen dwelling-place was in the
almost inaccessible cave situated near Llandovery, at the junction
of the Tywi and the Dethia (the Toothy of Drayton), which still
bears his name. As time passed on, he wooed and won the heiress of
Ystrad-ffin, in the vale of Tywi; and on becoming possessed of her
property, abandoned his wild life, and with it the name of Catti;
and quietly subsiding into Thomas Jones, Esq., became a poet and
antiquary of high reputation. In addition to which, and as if to
mark their sense of the value of a man so powerful for good or for
evil, the government appointed him high sheriff for the county of
Carmarthen. He died universally respected, and left a name which
yet kindles many a Welsh heart, or amuses many a cottage circle in
the long nights of winter.</p>
<p>His life has been published in an 8vo. volume, which was
probably the work to which the "Note" of "MELANION" referred.</p>

<p><i>Cheshire Round</i> (No. 24. p. 383.).&mdash;A dance so
called, peculiar to the county from whence it takes its name. The
musical notes of the <i>Cheshire Round</i> may be seen in <i>The
Dancing Master</i>, 1721, vol. i., and in Edward Jones' <i>Cheshire
Melodies</i>. It was sometimes danced "longways for as many us
will" (as described in <i>The Dancing Master</i>), but more
frequently by one person. A handbill of the time of William the
Third states, "In Bartholomew Fair, at the Coach-House on the Pav'd
stones at Hosier-Lane-End, you shall see a Black that dances the
<i>Cheshire Rounds</i> to the admiration of all spectators."
Michael Root and John Sleepe, two clever caterers of "Bartlemy,"
also advertise "a little boy that dances the <i>Cheshire Round</i>
to perfection." There is a portrait of Dogget the celebrated
comedian (said to be the only one extant, but query if it is not
Penkethman?), representing him dancing the <i>Cheshire Round</i>,
with the motto "<i>Ne sutor ultra crepidam</i>."</p>

<p><i>Horns to a River.</i>&mdash;Why the poets give horns to
rivers, must be sought for in the poet's book, nature. I like the
interpretation given by a glance up some sinuous and shelving
valley, where the mighty stream, more than half lost to the eye, is
only seen in one or two of its bolder reaches, as it tosses itself
here to the right, and there to the left, to find a way for its
mountain waters.</p>

<p><i>Coal Brandy</i> (No. 22. p. 352.).&mdash;This is only a
contraction of "coaled brandy," that is, "burnt brandy," and has no
reference to the <i>purity</i> of the spirit. It was the "universal
pectoral" of the last century; and more than once I have seen it
prepared by "good housewives" and "croaking husbands" in the
present, pretty much as directed in the following prescription. It
is only necessary to remark, that the orthodox method of "coaling,"
or setting the brandy on fire, was effected by dropping "a live
coal" ("<i>gleed</i>") or red-hot cinder into the brandy. This is
copied from a leaf of paper, on the other side of which are
written, in the hand of John Nourse, the great publisher of
scientific books in his day, some errata in the first 8vo. edit. of
Simsons's Euclid, and hence may be referred to the year 1762. It
was written evidently by some <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page457" id="page457"></a>{457}</span> "dropper-in," who found
"honest John" suffering from a severe cold, and upon the first
piece of paper that came to hand. The writer's caligraphy bespeaks
age, and the punctuation and erasures show him to have been a
literary man, and a careful though stilted writer. It is not,
however, a hand of which I find any other exemplars amongst
Nourse's correspondence.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Take two glasses of the best brandy, put them into a cup which
may stand over the fire; have two long wires, and put an ounce of
sugar-candy upon the wires, and set the brandy on fire. Let it burn
till it is put out by itself, and drink it before you go to
bed.</p>
<p>"To make it more pectoral, take some rosemary and put it in the

<p><i>Howkey or Horkey</i> (No. 17. p. 263.).&mdash;Does the
following passage from Sir Thomas Overbury's <i>Witty Descriptions
of the Properties of sundry Persons</i>, first published, I
believe, in 1614, afford any clue to the etymology of this word? It
occurs in the description of a Frankling or Yeoman:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"He allows of honest pastime, and thinks not the bones of the
dead anything bruised or the worse for it, though the country
lasses dance in the church-yard after even-song. Rock-Monday, and

<i>the hoky or seed-cake</i>, these he yearly keeps, yet holds them

<p>It may be possible further the purpose of the noble Querist as
to the word <i>Howkey</i> or <i>Horkey</i>, if I state, that when
in my boyhood I was accustomed to hear this word, it was pronounced
as if spelt <i>Hockey</i>. As <i>Howkey</i> I should not have
recognised it, nor hardly as <i>Horkey</i>.</p>
<p class="author">AN EAST ANGLIAN.</p>
<p><i>Hockey</i>, a game played by boys with a stick bent at the
end, is very likely derived from <i>hook</i>, an Anglo-Saxon word
too. But we cannot suppose that anything else was derived from
that, and especially when we come to words apparently more genuine
than that. It seems natural to connect them with a hock-tide,
Hoch-zeit (German), and Heoh-tid (A.-S.), a name given to more than
one season when it was usual to have games and festivities. Now
surely this is nothing else than <i>high</i> tide, a time of some
high feast; as we vulgarly say, "high days and holidays." So in the
Scripture, "that Sabbath day was a high day." So high Mass. We
Protestants have no conception of the close connection between the
superior sanctity and the superior jollity of a particular season.
Among the heathen Romans, <i>festicus</i> is derived from
<i>festus</i>.<a id="footnotetag3" name="footnotetag3"></a><a href=
"#footnote3"><sup>3</sup></a> We say high romps, high jinks.</p>
<p>See Wachter, who applies Hoch-zeit to Christmas, Easter, and
Whitsuntide, and says it may be derived either from high, or from
<i>Hogen</i>, "gaudere," which also see. He says that the lower
Saxons "hodie utuntur '<i>H&ouml;ge</i>'" to mean "gaudium privatum
et publicum convivale et nuptiale." See also Hohen. See Lye, who
has also heah, freols summa festivitas, summum festum.</p>
<p>Ihre (<i>Lex. Suio Goth.</i>) says <i>Hugna</i> is "to make
glad." But in Hog-tid he observes, that gladness is only the
secondary meaning of <i>Hogen</i>,&mdash;"<i>Hokanat</i> vocabatur
a Borealibus festum quod media hieme celebrabatur;" and he shows
that hawks were formerly sacrificed at it.</p>

deserving further consideration. Schedius (<i>De Diis Gemanis</i>)
and others have, with much learning, shown Venus Urania to be the
same as Isis Myrionyma. With erudition not inferior, but in support
of a peculiar theory, Gorop. Bacanus maintains Harpocrates and
Cupido, son of Venus Uranis, to be one and the same hieroglyphical
character. I shall now endeavour to explain the symbolism and
dedication of the Rose. This "flower of flowers" adumbrates the
highest faculty of human nature&mdash;<i>Reason</i>, and Silence,
or the rest of the reasoning powers, which is indicated by the
Greek term [Greek: epistaemae], <i>science</i>. (See Harris's
<i>Philosoph. Arrang.</i> p. 444., and <i>Hermes</i>, p. 369.). To
whom, then, could the hieroglyphical rose have been more

<p>I conjecture that Teneber Wednesday is the Wednesday next before
Easter, of "Feria quarta majoris Hebdomadao," and that the name is
derived form the Gospel for that day according to the ritual of the
Church of Rome.</p>

it is placed between Lady Day and Easter Even.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Sovente me sorene</i>,</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>belongs to the French idiom, and answers to our phrase "Forget
me not." Such a sentiment would be sufficiently appropriate as the
parting prayer or injunction of a lover, but does not possess the
essential characteristic of a <i>motto</i>, which one selects for
the purpose of declaring his own sentiments of conduct towards
<i>others</i>, not to deprecate or direct those of others towards
<i>himself</i>.</p>
<p>The language employed is, in part, pure Italian, not antiquated,
but exactly such as is spoken by persons of education at the
present day; and if "S." would again examine the original MS., I
make no doubt that he would find the line written <i>Sovente mi
sooviene (sovene)</i>, <i>i.e.</i> with the personal pronoun in the
dative instead of the accusative case. The expression <i>mi
souviene</i> is equivalent to <i>mi ricordo</i>, but is a more
elegant form that the latter; and the meaning of the motto will be
"I seldom forget,"&mdash;a pithy and suggestive sentence, implying
as much the memory of a wrong to be avenged as of a favour to be
required.</p>

<p><i>Larig.</i>&mdash;I am obliged by the suggestions of your
correspondents "B.W." and "C.I.R." (No. 24. p. 387.), to which I
beg leave to offer the following reply. The Dutch and Flemish (or
Netherlandish, as they may be considered one language until the
fifteenth century) <i>Le'er</i> and <i>Le'ar</i> are simply
contractions of <i>Leder</i>, as Tenkate observes, <i>euphonis
gratia</i>, by the omission of the <i>d</i>, which takes place in
other similar words; and what is remarkable in <i>Ledig</i>, empty,
which becomes <i>Le'eg</i>. <i>Le'erig</i> is of course
<i>leathery</i>, or <i>tough</i>; but <i>Lederen</i> or
<i>Le'ersen</i>, would be used for <i>made</i> of <i>leather</i>,
and in A.-S., most probably [A-S: hydig]. We have no such
contraction in A.-S.: it is always [A-S: Le&eth;er] and [A-S:
Le&eth;ern]. The epithet, <i>leathery</i>-shields, could hardly
have been used where they are said to <i>resound</i>; and the
instance of <i>vaulted</i> shields in Judith is, I think,
conclusive. The root of <i>Leder</i> is possibly <i>hlid-an</i>, to
cover HIDE? That of <i>Leer</i> possibly <i>lieren</i>, amittere,
privari?</p>
<p>I should have noted the instances of the word from Junius and
Schilter, which were not unknown to me, but for brevity's sake; and
indeed I had not Urry's <i>Chaucer</i> at hand to verify the
reference of Junius to the Tale of Beryn, the only valuable portion
of Urry's book. I knew that a simple reference to the O.H.G.
L&acirc;ri would be sufficient for Dr. Grimm.</p>

instances in his Glossary of similar combinations, as

religion</i>; and that, according to Theodoret, it was to please
her that Paul of Samosata, whom she patronised, professed opinions
very like those of the Jews concerning the person of Jesus Christ,
saying that he was only a mere man, who had nothing in his nature
superior to other men, nor was distinguished from them any
otherwise than by a more abundant participation of the divine
grace."&mdash;Crevier, <i>Hist. of Rom. Emperors</i>, Book 27.

<p><i>"Who was Temple Stanyan?"</i> (no. 24. p. 382.) Temple
Stanyan was the son of Abraham Stanyan, Esq., a Member of the Kit
Kat Club, M.P. for Buckingham, Ambassador to the Porte, a Lord of
the Admiralty, etc. Mr. Temple Stanyan was himself also Minister at
Constantinople, and at several other courts; and afterwards
Under-Secretary of State under both Addison and the Duke of
Newcastle. He published in 1714 an Account of Switzerland; and his
Grecian history in 2 vols. was, till the publication of Mitford's,
the best in our language. I believe that his daughter married Adm.
Sir Charles Hardy. He died in 1752.</p>

Howgill. Howgill was originally a clergyman of the Church of

joined the early Quakers, upon hearing the preaching of George Fox.
His works were published in folio, in 1676, by Ellis Hookes.</p>

<p><i>Malone's Blunder</i> (No. 25. p. 403.).&mdash;"Mr. BOLTON
CORNEY," in his answer on this subject, says very justly, that
"before we censure a writer, we should consult his own edition." He
has, however, not followed this excellent principle in this case,
for he has certainly not looked at the Irish edition of Malone, on
which the question arises. He has repeated what I had already
stated (No. 24. p. 386.), that the mistake was <i>not</i> a blunder
of <i>Malone's</i>; and he has also pointed out, what had escaped
me, Malone's supplemental note containing the first <i>three</i>
articles of the pretended will of <i>John</i> Shakspeare: but when
he adds that there is "<i>no fabrication</i>" and "<i>no
mystery</i>" in the case, and that "the blunder of the Irish editor
was merely in attempting to <i>unite the two fragments</i> as
published by Malone," it is quite clear that he has not seen the
edition in question, and has, I think, mistaken the whole affair.
The Irish editor did <i>not</i> attempt to unite Malone's
fragments&mdash;quite the contrary&mdash;he left Malone's first
fragment as he found it; but he took the second fragment, namely,
the exordium of the pretended will of <i>John</i> Shakspeare, and
substituted it <i>bodily</i> as the exordium of the will of
<i>William</i> Shakspeare, suppressing altogether the real exordium
of the latter. So that this Irish will begins, "I, <i>John</i>
Shakspeare," &amp;c., and ends, "by me, <i>William</i> Shakspeare."
I have no doubt that the will of John Shakspeare is a forgery
altogether; but the taking three paragraphs of it, and substituting
them for the two first paragraphs of <i>William</i> Shakspeare's
genuine will, is what I call, and what no doubt "Mr. BOLTON CORNEY"
will think, on this explanation of the facts, "an audacious
fabrication." The best guess I can make as to how, or with what
design, the Irish editor should have perpetrated so complicated,
and yet so manifest a blunder, is this:&mdash;Malone printed the
fragment in question at the end of his volume, amongst his
"Emendations and additions," as belonging to "<i>the will before
printed</i>," meaning the forged will of <i>John</i> Shakspeare,
but that the Irish editor understood him to mean the genuine will
of <i>William</i> Shakspeare; and so thought that he was only
restoring the latter to its integrity: but how he could have
overlooked the difference of names, and the want of continuity in
the meaning of the documents, is still to me utterly
incomprehensible.</p>

<p><i>Theses.</i>&mdash;Perhaps it may assist your correspondent
"M." (No. 25. p. 401.) to be informed that the University of
G&ouml;ttingen is particularly rich in "<i>Theses</i>" (termed
<i>Disputationes et Dissertationes</i>), to which there is a large
room entirely devoted in the library of that university; together
with the transactions of learned bodies. A special librarian is
attached to this department, which is much consulted. A Catalogue
was begun to be published of this collection, so far as respects
the <i>Memoirs</i> contained in the various transactions, in 1801,
by J.D. Reuss; and 16 vols. in 4to. had appeared up to 1821; after
which, I believe, the publication has been suspended. Of Catalogues
of Theses, I think the following work is in good
esteem:&mdash;<i>Dissert. Acad. Upsal. habit&aelig; sub
Pr&aelig;sid. C.P. Thunberg</i>, 3 tom. 8vo. G&ouml;tting.
1799-1801. The second part of vol. ii. in the <i>Catalogus
Bibliothec&aelig; Thottiau&aelig;</i> (7 vol. 8vo. Fauni&aelig;,
1789-1795.) contains a catalogue, which it might be well to
consult, of dissertations under the name of the president or head
of the institution or college where they were delivered, than under
the writer's name. At least, in a <i>collective</i> sense the
former method is adopted, as in the following instance: Schultens,
(Alb.) <i>Sylloge Dissertationem Philologico-Eregeticarum,
adiversis Auctoribus Editarum, sub Pr&aelig;sidio A. Schultens,
etc.</i>, 2 tom.: although, if the author should happen to be
distinguished for his other productions, <i>all</i> that he wrote
is anxiously sought out, and placed under his own name.</p>

<h2>MISCELLANIES.</h2>
<p><i>Spur Money.</i>&mdash;Although I used often, twenty years
ago, when a chorister at the Chapel Royal, to take part in levying
a fine on all who entered that place with spurs on, I was not aware
of its origin till I saw it explained in your interesting
publication (No. 23. p. 374.). There was a custom however,
connected with this impost, the origin of which I should be glad to
learn. After the claim was made, the person from whom it was sought
to be exacted had the power to summon the youngest chorister before
him, and request him to "repeat his gamut," and if he failed, the
spur-bearer was entitled to exemption.</p>
<p class="author">E.J.H.</p>

<p><i>Note Books.</i>&mdash;Looking at what your correspondent says
about "Note Books," I think the following hint may be useful to
others, as it has been to myself. Many persons never get so far as
the formality of a common-place book, and do not like to write in
their books. Let them follow my plan. The envelope maker will
procure them any number of little slips of white paper, with a
touch of isinglass at each of the four corners. Let the note be
written on one of these, and then let the slip be stuck into any
book which is sure to be wanted in connection with the subject when
it comes up again; either by one, two, or four corners, as
convenient. The isinglass will not hurt the book, if ever it be
wanted to remove the slip. A note is more in the way, when attached
to a book which suggested it, than when buried among unindexed
miscellanies; and there are few who index themselves. Your motto is
good as far as it goes; but the other half is wanting:&mdash;</p>

<h3>LADY RACHAEL RUSSELL.</h3>
<p>Mr. Dyce has admitted Lady Rachael Russell among his <i>British
Poetesses</i> on account of the following verses:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>TO THE MEMORY OF HER HUSBAND.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Right noble twice, by virtue and by birth,</p>
<p>Of Heaven lov'd, and honour'd on the earth;</p>
<p>His country's hope, his kindred's chief delight,</p>
<p>My husband dear, more than this world's light,</p>
<p>Death hath me reft. But I from death will take</p>
<p>His memory, to whom this tomb I make.</p>
<p>John was his name (ah, was! wretch must I say),</p>
<p>Lord Russell once, now my tear-thirsty clay."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Now "John" was not the Christian name of William Lord Russell,
so that these verses could not have come from his widow's pen.
Indeed, they are much older than Lady Rachael's time, and may be
found on the monument in Westminster Abbey erected by Lady Russell,
in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, to John Lord Russell, who died in
1584.</p>

<p><i>Byron and Tacitus</i> (No. 20. p. 390.).&mdash;To your young
friend, who honestly signs himself "A SCHOOLBOY," let an older
correspondent say, that he will do more wisely to let the rules of
his teachers keep him from perusing an author who makes a mock of
all moral and all honourable feelings. But if he wishes to know
whether the introduction of the sentence from Tacitus into a
poetical tale should be called "cabbaging," the reply will properly
be, No. The poet expected that the well-known figure, which he had
thus thrown into verse, would be immediately recognised by every
literary reader, and that the recognition would give pleasure. He
was trying his hand at a task of which it has been affirmed by a
master, that <i>Difficile est proprie communia dicere</i>. The
Schoolboy knows where to find these words; and I hope that he also
knows where to find the words of one who speaks with greater
authority, and has said most kindly, "Cease, my son, to hear [read]
the instruction that causeth to err."</p>

<p><i>Aboriginal Chambers near Tilbury.</i>&mdash;It is proposed to
descend some of the aboriginal chambers alluded to by Camden, near
Tilbury in Essex. In consequence, however, of Camden having named a
wrong parish, later antiquaries have been puzzled to ascertain
their precise whereabouts. Mr. Crafter, in 1848, after many days'
labour, found them out; and a brief notice of them was given
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page463" id=
"page463"></a>{463}</span> in an article upon "Prim&aelig;val
Britain" in the <i>West Kent Almanack for</i> 1849. Hasted mentions
similar pits in Crayford Parish, Kent. In Dartford parish is
another called "the Sound Hole," from the echoes, &amp;c., made
upon a stone being thrown down. Mr. S. Laudale intends an
examination of it this summer. Tradition reports that there are
three enormous caverns, which communicate with the central
shaft.</p>

those chambers which are aloof from the central shaft?</p>

II. It fetched 51<i>l.</i>, being bought by a collector whose name
has not transpired; but perhaps this notice, if you kindly insert
it, may induce the purchaser to edit it for the Chetham Society, to
whose publications it would for a most valuable addition.</p>
<p class="author">R.</p>
<p><i>A Phonetic Peculiarity.</i>&mdash;I venture to note as a very
curious phonetic peculiarity, that we have in the English language
a large number of monosyllabic words ending is <i>sh</i>, all of
which are expressive of some violet action or emotion. I quote a
few which have occurred without search, in alphabetical order.
"Brush, brash, crash, crush, dash, gash, gush, hash, gnash, lash,

<h2>MISCELLANEOUS.</h2>
<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, CATALOGUES, SALES, ETC.</h3>
<p>At the late Annual Meeting of the Shakespeare Society it was
announced that a complete collection of the works of Thomas Heywood
had been determined upon, and the first volume containing six plays
was laid upon the table. It was also shown that Mr. Collier's
<i>Essay on the Chandos Portrait</i> had only been delayed from a
desire to obtain the most novel and accurate information.</p>
<p>The members of the Percy Society will be glad to hear, that at
the Annual Meeting on the 1st instant, the immediate publication of
the third volume of Mr. Wright's edition of the <i>Canterbury
Tales</i> was announced.</p>
<p>The plan for the <i>restoration of Chaucer's tomb</i> in Poet's
Corner has at length assumed a practical shape. It has been
ascertained that less than 100<i>l.</i> will do every thing that
can be desired to repair the ravages of time, and preserve the
monument for centuries to come. It is proposed to raise this sum by
subscriptions of five shillings, that more may share in the good
work; and a committee has been formed to carry out this scheme,
which has already received the sanction of the Earl of Carlisle,
the Earl of Ellesmere, Lord Braybrooke, Mr. Charles Wynn, and other
distinguished lovers of literature. Subscriptions are received by
every member of the committee, and parties resident in the country
may remit them by post-office orders payable at Charing Cross in
favour of William Richard Drake, Esq., F.S.A., of 46. Parliament
Street, the Honorary Treasurer; or of William J. Thoms, Esq., the
Honorary Secretary of the Committee.</p>
<p>The Annual Meeting of the Camden Society on the 2d instant,
under the Presidentship of Lord Braybrooke, gave general
satisfaction. The council reported the publication during the past
year of the <i>Peterborough Chronicle</i>; the <i>Letters of
Elizabeth and James VI.</i>; and the <i>Chronicle of Queen
Jane</i>. This last volume was then only on the eve of circulation;
it has since been issued, and found to justify the announcement of
the council that it is work of great historical value, and an
interesting companion to <i>Machyn's Diary</i>.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
